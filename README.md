	"github.com/faelmori/keepgo"
)

type program struct{}

func (p *program) Start(s keepgo.Service) error {
	go p.run()
	return nil
}

func (p *program) run() {
	fmt.Println("Service running...")
}

func (p *program) Stop(s keepgo.Service) error {
	fmt.Println("Service stopped.")
	return nil
}

func main() {
	svcConfig := &keepgo.Config{Name: "MyService"}
	prg := &program{}
	srv, err := keepgo.New(prg, svcConfig)

## KeepGo vs Other Libraries

KeepGo is a fork of [kardianos/service](https://github.com/kardianos/service) with improvements in:

- **Usability:** More intuitive API for developers.
- **Documentation:** Clearer guides and examples.
- **Efficiency:** Lightweight and optimized for Go service execution.

---

## Considerations

- **Linux:** Dependency management is not fully supported.
- **macOS:** `UserService Interactive` mode may have limitations.
